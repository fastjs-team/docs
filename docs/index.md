# Introduction

## What is it?

Fastjs is a useful, lightweight JavaScript library for any types of project.

It is designed to be easy to use. Fastjs can be with any framework or just pure JavaScript.

## Why Fastjs?

Fastjs contains a collection of utilities that are commonly used in JavaScript development, we put different functions into different modules, so you can use them separately.

Fastjs have it's own design rules, every module follows the same design rules, so you can learn one module, and you can use all of them.

Fastjs API is designed to be easy to use, you can just learning them with just the type hints in your IDE, even don't need to read the document.

## Why not other libraries?

We consider the needs of users from many aspects from the user's perspective, and we have a clear design goal.

### Installation

We believe that the installation process should be as simple as possible, so fastjs is a all-in-one library, it includes a lot of features that commonly used in JavaScript development.

### API Design

We know that a clear and easy-to-use API is very important, so we design the API to be easy to use, and the function names are easy to understand.

### TypeScript Support

We provide full TypeScript support, and we export almost all types that you may need when using fastjs, to help you getting strong type hints in your IDE.

### Environment Support

Fastjs is a powerful library, we believe that user in different environments may choose to use fastjs, so fastjs can run in anywhere.

## What is our goal?

We build Fastjs because there are too many libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem,
and it is hard to choose one, and also their quality is uneven.

Every library has its own way to do things, and it is hard to learn them all.
We want to build a library that can solve these problems.

We envision a library that offers a uniform API for its modules,
with the capability to function in diverse environments like Node.js and browsers.
Our goal is to reduce the learning curve and provide a reliable, all-in-one utility belt for developers.
